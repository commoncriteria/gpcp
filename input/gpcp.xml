	<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
		A general-purpose computing platform is a hardware device that is capable of hosting more than one 
		different operating system, virtualization system, or bare-metal application. Typical platform 
		implementations include servers, PC clients, laptops, and tablets.<h:p/>
		Mobile Device platforms as defined in the Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals and 
		Network Device platforms as defined in the collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices 
		are out of scope of this PP.  Mobile Device and Network Device platforms must be evaluated 
		against the more specific requirements in their respective specialized PPs.

		<!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->	    
		<section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
			The TOE comprises the hardware and firmware necessary for the hosting of tenant software. Generally,
			tenant software is an operating system or virtualization system, but may also be "bare-metal" applications.
			Tenant software is outside the TOE boundary.<h:p/>
			For example, for a PC Client platform, the hardware and firmware responsible for booting the platform and 
			operation of platform devices (such as BIOS, device controller firmware, and plaform management firmware would all 
			be included in the TOE. Operating systems and application software is outside the TOE.<h:p/>
			For server-class hardware, any management controller responsible for updating platform firmware (such as a 
			baseboard management controller) is expressly included within the TOE.<h:p/>
			<figure entity="images/arch.png" title="High-Level Architecture of a Generic Platform" id="toe"/><h:p/>
			Figure 1 (taken from <h:a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-193.pdf">
			NIST SP 800-193</h:a>) shows a high-level system architecture for a typical generic computing platform.
			Tenant software (operating system/virtualization system and applications) is shown in orange.
			The tenant-specific software responsible for booting the tenant (Master Boot Record, etc.) is shown
			in grey. Platform components are in blue.<h:p/>
			For purposes of these requirements, the TOE consists of the platform components represented 
			by the blue boxes, along with their associated firmware. Any particular platform may have 
			additional hardware components, or fewer than those illustrated.
      </section>

		<!-- 1.3.2 TOE Operational Environment -->
		<section title="TOE Operational Environment" id="TOEopenv">
			  The TOE has no platform since it is itself a platform, but the TOE does have an operational
			  environment. The OE consists of the physical environment in which the TOE operates (e.g., 
			  data center, enterprise office, vehicle, outdoors) and any networks to which the TOE may
			  be connected. Different use cases may invoke different requirements depending on the 
			  operational environment.

	<!--   1.5 Roles -->
    <section title="Roles" id="roles">
		For purposes of these requirements there are three main entities that interact with a general-purpose computing 
		platform: <h:ol type="1">
			<h:li>Tenant Software</h:li>
			<h:li>Users (non-privileged users)</h:li>
    		<h:li>Administrators (privileged users)</h:li> </h:ol>
		Tenant Software generally consists of an operating system, virtualization system, or application
		that uses platform resources to run workloads on behalf of Users. Tenant software is necessarily privileged
    	on the platform.<h:p/>
    	Users are humans who interact with the platform through user interfaces. They generally have to authenticate 
    	thenselves to tenant software (e.g. an operating system), but generally not to the platform itself.<h:p/>
    	Administrators are humans who manage the platform through some kind of administrative interface. The interface
    	may be local or remote to the platform. <h:p/>
		In this context, Administrators manage the physical platform, not the OS (OS Admins would be classified
		as platform Users). Only Administrators need to be authenticated to the platform. For an EUD, this could generally
		be accomplished through an interface implemented in firmware. For server-class hardware, the management
		interface could be implemented in a management controller that is part of the platform. Administrators 
		must authenticate themselves to the platform before the platform can allow them to perform administrative
		tasks.<h:p/>
		Administrators are assumed to be acting in the best interests of the platform owner.

                        configuration (including enabling or disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the TOE

						of standards) selected in the ST.<h:p/>
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall verify that the AGD guidance instructs the administrator how

					</Guidance>
					<KMD>
						If the TOE uses the generated key in a key chain/hierarchy then the evaluator shall

						<h:li>If "<h:i>RSA</h:i>" is selected, then the KMD describes which methods for generating p
							and q are used</h:li>
						<h:li>How the key is used as part of the key chain/hierarchy. </h:li></h:ul>
					</KMD>
					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						<h:b>RSA: RSA Key Generation</h:b><h:br/>
						The below tests are derived from The 186-4 RSA Validation System (RSA2VS),
						Updated 8 July 2014, Section 6.2, from the National Institute of Standards and
						Technology.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify the implementation of RSA Key Generation by the TOE
						using the Key Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly
						produce values for the key components including the public verification exponent
						e, the private prime factors p and q, the public modulus n and the calculation of the
						private signature exponent d.<h:p/>
						FIPS 186-4 Key Pair generation specifies 5 methods for generating the primes p
						and q.<h:p/>
						These are:<h:ol type="1">
							<h:li>Random Primes:<h:ul>
								<h:li>Provable primes</h:li>
								<h:li>Probable primes</h:li></h:ul></h:li>
							<h:li>Primes with Conditions:<h:ul>
								<h:li>Primes p1, p2, q1, q2, p and q shall all be provable primes.</h:li>
								<h:li>Primes p1, p2, q1, and q2 shall be provable primes and p and q shall be
									probable primes</h:li>
								<h:li>Primes p1, p2, q1, q2, p and q shall all be probable primes.</h:li></h:ul></h:li>
						</h:ol>	
						To test the key generation method for the Random Provable primes method and for
						all the Primes with Conditions methods, the evaluator must seed the TSF key
						generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the RSA key
						pair.<h:p/>
						For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key
						pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation by
						comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated by a known good
						implementation using the same input parameters.<h:p/>
						If the TOE generates Random Probable Primes then if possible, the Random
						Probable primes method should also be verified against a known good
						implementation as described above. If verification against a known good
						implementation is not possible, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key
						pairs for each supported key length nlen and verify that all of the following are true:<h:ul>
						<h:li>n = p*q</h:li>
						<h:li>p and q are probably prime according to Miller-Rabin tests with error
							probability &lt;2^(-125)</h:li>
						<h:li>2^16 &lt; e &lt; 2^256 and e is an odd integer</h:li>
						<h:li>GCD(p-1,e) = 1</h:li>
						<h:li>GCD(q-1,e) = 1</h:li>
						<h:li>|p-q| > 2^(nlen/2 - 100)</h:li>
						<h:li>p >= squareroot(2)*( 2^(nlen/2 -1) )</h:li>
						<h:li>q >= squareroot(2)*( 2^(nlen/2 -1) )</h:li>
						<h:li>2^(nlen/2) &lt; d &lt; LCM(p-1,q-1)</h:li>
						<h:li>e*d = 1 mod LCM(p-1,q-1)</h:li></h:ul><h:p/>
						<h:b>ECC-N &amp; ECC-B: ECC Key Generation with NIST and Brainpool Curves</h:b><h:p/>
						These tests are derived from The FIPS 186-4 Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
						Algorithm Validation System (ECDSA2VS), Updated 18 Mar 2014, Section 6.<h:p/>
						<h:b>ECC Key Generation Test</h:b><h:p/>
						For each selected curve, and for each key pair generation method as described in
						FIPS 186-4, section B.4, the evaluator shall require the implementation under test
						to generate 10 private/public key pairs (d, Q). The private key, d, shall be generated 
						using a random bit generator as specified in FCS_RBG_EXT.1. The private key, d,
						is used to compute the public key, Q’. The evaluator shall confirm that 0&lt;d&lt;n
						(where n is the order of the group), and the computed value Q’ is then compared to
						the generated public/private key pairs’ public key, Q, to confirm that Q is equal to
						Q’.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Public Key Validation (PKV) Test</h:b><h:p/>
						For each supported curve, the evaluator shall generate 12 private/public key pairs
						using the key generation function of a known good implementation and modify six
						of the public key values so that they are incorrect, leaving six values unchanged
						(i.e., correct). To determine correctness, the evaluator shall submit the 12 key pairs
						to the public key validation (PKV) function of the TOE and shall confirm that the
						results correspond as expected to the modified and unmodified values.<h:p/>
						<h:b>DSA: DSA Key Generation using Finite-Field Cryptography (FFC)</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the Parameters Generation and the
						Key Generation for FFC by the TOE using the Parameter Generation and Key
						Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly produce values
						for the field prime p, the cryptographic prime q (dividing p-1), the cryptographic
						group generator g, and the calculation of the private key x and public key y.<h:p/>
						The Parameter generation specifies 2 ways (or methods) to generate the
						cryptographic prime q and the field prime p:<h:ul>
							<h:li>Primes q and p shall both be provable primes</h:li>
							<h:li>Primes q and field prime p shall both be probable primes</h:li></h:ul>
						and two ways to generate the cryptographic group generator g:<h:ul>
							<h:li>Generator g constructed through a verifiable process</h:li>
							<h:li>Generator g constructed through an unverifiable process.</h:li></h:ul>
						The Key generation specifies 2 ways to generate the private key x:<h:ul>
							<h:li>len(q) bit output of RBG where 1 &#8804; x &#8804; q-1</h:li>
							<h:li>len(q) + 64 bit output of RBG, followed by a mod q-1 operation and a +1
								operation, where 1&#8804; x&#8804;q-1. </h:li></h:ul>
						The security strength of the RBG must be at least that of the security offered by the
						FFC parameter set.<h:p/>
						To test the cryptographic and field prime generation method for the provable primes
						method or the group generator g for a verifiable process, the evaluator must seed
						the TSF parameter generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically
						generate the parameter set.<h:p/>
						For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25
						parameter sets and key pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s
						implementation by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated
						from a known good implementation. Verification must also confirm<h:ul>
						<h:li>g != 0,1</h:li>
						<h:li>q divides p-1</h:li>
						<h:li>g^q mod p = 1</h:li>
						<h:li>g^x mod p = y</h:li></h:ul>
						for each FFC parameter set and key pair.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Curve25519: Curve25519 Key Generation</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall require the implementation under test (IUT) to generate 10
						private/public key pairs. The private key shall be generated as specified in RFC
						7748 using an approved random bit generator (RBG) and shall be written in littleendian order (least significant byte first. To determine correctness, the evaluator
						shall submit the generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function
						of a known good implementation.<h:p/>
						Note: Assuming the PKV function of the good implementation will (using little-endian order):
						<h:ul>
							<h:li>Confirm the private and public keys are 32-byte values</h:li>
							<h:li>Confirm the three least significant bits of the first byte of the private key are
								zero</h:li>
							<h:li>Confirm the most significant bit of the last byte is zero</h:li>
							<h:li>Confirm the second most significant bit of the last byte is one</h:li>
							<h:li>Calculate the expected public key from the private key and confirm it matches
								the supplied public key</h:li>
						</h:ul>
						The evaluator shall generate 10 private/public key pairs using the key generation
						function of a known good implementation and modify 5 of the public key values so
						that they are incorrect, leaving five values unchanged (i.e. correct). The evaluator
						shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

				<note role="application">
					This SFR must be included in the ST if the TOE handles sensitive cryptographic keys or credentials.
					In particular, if the TOE creates or stores keys, it must be able to destroy them.<h:p/>
					The platform must implement mechanisms to destroy cryptographic keys and key material contained in
					persistent storage when no longer needed. The term “cryptographic keys” in this SFR includes
					the authorization data that is the entry point to a key chain and all other cryptographic keys and
					keying material (whether in plaintext or encrypted form). This SFR does not apply to the public
					component of asymmetric key pairs, or to keys that are permitted to remain stored such as device
					identification keys.<h:p/>
					In the case of volatile memory, the selection “<h:i>removal of all references to the key directly followed
					by a request for garbage collection</h:i>” is used in a situation where the TSF cannot address the
					specific physical memory locations holding the data to be erased and therefore relies on
					addressing logical addresses (which frees the relevant physical addresses holding the old data)
					and then requesting the platform to ensure that the data in the physical addresses is no longer
					available for reading (i.e. the “garbage collection” referred to in the SFR text).
					Guidance documentation for the TOE requires users not to allow the TOE to leave the user’s
					control while a session is active (and hence while the DEK is likely to be in plaintext in volatile
					memory).<h:p/>
					The selection for destruction of data in non-volatile memory includes block erase as an option,
					and this option applies only to flash memory. A block erase does not require a read verify, since 
					collaborative Protection Profile for Dedicated Security Components
					the mappings of logical addresses to the erased memory locations are erased as well as the data
					itself.<h:p/>
					Where different destruction methods are used for different data or different destruction situations
					then the different methods and the data/situations they apply to (e.g. different points in time, or
					power-loss situations) are described in the TSS (and the ST may use separate iterations of the SFR
					to aid clarity). The TSS includes a table describing all relevant keys and keying material (including
					authorization data) used in the implementation of the SFRs, stating the source of the data, all
					memory types in which the data is stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session,
					and both plaintext and non-plaintext forms of the data), and the applicable destruction method
					and time of destruction in each case.<h:p/>
					Some selections allow assignment of “some value that does not contain any CSP.” This means
					that the TOE uses some specified data not drawn from an RBG meeting FCS_RBG_EXT
					requirements, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The point
					of the phrase “does not contain any sensitive data” is to ensure that the overwritten data is
					carefully selected, and not taken from a general pool that might contain current or residual data
					(e.g. SDOs or intermediate key chain values) that itself requires confidentiality protection.<h:p/>
				</note>
				<aactivity>
					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying
						material (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is
						stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and
						non-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the
						point in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe
						function, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an
						intermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case. The evaluator shall
						confirm that the description of the data and storage locations is consistent with the
						functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys in the key chain are accounted
						for). (Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key then this may need to
						be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description 
						of keys with the TOE functions). <h:p/>
						The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or
						circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further
						discussion in the AGD section below). Note that reference may be made to the AGD
						for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or
						delayed.<h:p/>
						Where the ST specifies the use of “a value that does not contain any sensitive data”
						to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes
						how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern
						does not contain any sensitive data. <h:p/>
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation for the TOE requires
						users to ensure that the TOE remains under the user’s control while a session is
						active.<h:p/>
						A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay data destruction in
						some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies
						configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction
						requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS
						(and KMD). The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides
						guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer,
						identifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some
						operation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the
						device for some particular time to maximise the probability that garbage collection
						will have occurred).<h:p/>
						For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
						possible that the storage may implement wear-levelling and garbage collection. This
						may result in additional copies of the data that are logically inaccessible but persist
						physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM
						command	and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their
						deletion (this would be explained in TSS and guidance documentation). <h:p/>
						Where TRIM is used then the TSS or guidance documentation is also expected to describe how
						the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g. they would need not
						to be contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the
						master file table.<h:p/>
					</Guidance>
					<KMD>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to verify that it identifies and describes the
						interfaces that are used to service commands to read/write memory. The evaluator
						shall examine the interface description for each different media type to ensure that
						the interface supports the selections made by the ST author.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that all keys and keying material
						identified in the TSS and KMD have been accounted for.<h:p/>
						Note that where selections include "<h:i>destruction of reference to the key directly
						followed by a request for garbage collection</h:i>" (for volatile memory) then the
						evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it explains the nature of the
						destruction of the reference, the request for garbage collection, and of the garbage
						collection process itself.<h:p/>
					</KMD>
					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
						<testlist>
							<test>
								Applied to each key or keying material held as plaintext in volatile
								memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the
								plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile
								memory).<h:p/>
								The evaluator shall:<h:ol type="1">
								<h:li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #2 to locate all
									instances of the known key value from Step #1.<h:p/>
									Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
									search commands are being used for Steps #8 and #9.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
									from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to destroy the key.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to stop execution but not exit.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary
									file.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #7 for instances of the
									known key value from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
									fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
									evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
									stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
									any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
									endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search.)</h:li>
								</h:ol><h:p/>
								Steps #1-8 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile
								memory. If a copy is found, then the test fails.<h:p/>
								Step #9 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If the
								evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately.
								Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some
								random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated
								with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run
								then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the
								collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.<h:p/>
							</test>
							<test>
								Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
								subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<h:ol type="1">
								<h:li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
									from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the non-volatile memory the key was stored in for instances of the
									known key value from Step #1. <h:p/>
									Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
									search commands are being used for Steps #5 and #6.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the non-volatile memory in which the key was stored for instances
									of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</h:li>
								<h:li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
									fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
									evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
									stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
									any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
									endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search).</h:li>
								</h:ol>
								Step #6 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in non-volatile memory.
								If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail
								immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key
								(e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be
								repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this
								repeated run then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable
								explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.
							</test>
							<test>
								Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
								subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<h:ol type="1">
								<h:li>Record memory of the key or keying material.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
									from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to clear the key. Record the value to be used for the
									overwrite of the key. </h:li>
								<h:li>Examine the memory from Step #1 to ensure the appropriate pattern
									(recorded in Step #3) is used. </h:li>
								</h:ol>
								The test succeeds if correct pattern is found in the memory location. If the pattern
								is not found, then the test fails.

				<note role="application">
					This SFR must be included in the ST if key derivation is a service provided by the TOE to tenant software,
					or if it is used by the TOE itself to support or implement PP-specified security functionality.<h:p/> 
<!--					This SFR must be included in the ST if "<h:i>Derived KEKs...</h:i>" is selected in FCS_CKM.1/KEK, or if
					"<h:i>XOR</h:i>" is selected in FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc.<h:p/>  -->
					This SFR must be included in the ST if "<h:i>XOR</h:i>" is selected in FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc.<h:p/>
					The interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, the most likely of which is
					an application programming interface to an OS kernel. There may be various levels of abstraction.
					For Authorization Factor Submasks, the key size to be used in the HMAC falls into a range between
					L1 and L2 defined in ISO/IEC 10118 for the appropriate hash function (for example for SHA-256
					L1 = 512, L2 = 256) where L2 = k = L1.<h:p/>
					NIST SP 800-131A Rev 1 allows the use of SHA-1 in these use cases.<h:p/>
					KDF-ENC and KDF-XOR create an “inverted key hierarchy” in which the TSF will combine two or more 
					keys to create a third key. These same KDFs may also
					use a submask key as input, which could be an authorization factor or derived from a PBKDF. In
					these cases the ST author must explicitly declare this option and should present a reasonable
					argument that the entropy of the inputs to the KDFs will result in full entropy of the expected
					output.<h:p/>
					If keys are combined, the ST author shall describe which method of combination is used in order
					to justify that the effective entropy of each factor is preserved.<h:p/>
					The documentation of the product’s encryption key management should be detailed enough that,
					after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the product’s key management and how it
					meets the requirements to ensure the keys are adequately protected. This documentation should
					include an essay and diagrams. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS; it can be
					submitted as a separate document and marked as developer proprietary.<h:p/>
<!--					SP 800-56C specifies a two-step key derivation procedure that employs an extraction-then 
					expansion technique for deriving keying material from a shared secret generated during a key
					establishment scheme. The Randomness Extraction step as described in Section 5 of SP 800-56C
					is followed by Key Expansion using the key derivation functions defined in SP 800-108.<h:p/> -->
					This requirement must be claimed by the TOE if at least one of FCS_CKM.1/KEK,
					FCS_CKM.1/SK, or FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc chooses a selection related to key derivation.<h:p/>
					If at least one of KDF-XOR or KDF-ENC is selected AND password-based key derivation
					is used to create at least one of the inputs, the selection-based SFR FCS_COP.1/PBKDF must also
					be claimed.<h:p/>

				<aactivity>
					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall check that the TSS includes a description of the key derivation
						functions and shall check that this uses a key derivation algorithm and key sizes
						according to the specification selected in the ST out of the table as provided in the
						cPP table per row. The evaluator shall confirm that the TSS supports the selected
						methods.<h:p/>
<!--						If <h:u>KeyDrv5</h:u> is selected, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS shows that the total
						length of the concatenated keys used as input to the KDF is greater than or equal to
						the length of the output from the KDF.<h:p/>  -->
						[conditional] If key combination is used to form a KEK, the evaluator shall verify
						that the TSS describes the method of combination and that this method is either an
						XOR, a KDF, or encryption.<h:p/>
						[conditional] If a KDF is used to form a KEK, the evaluator shall ensure that the
						TSS includes a description of the key derivation function and shall verify the key
						derivation uses an approved derivation mode and key expansion algorithm
						according to SP 800-108.<h:p/>
						[conditional] If key concatenation is used to derive KEKs, the evaluator
						shall ensure the TSS includes a description of the randomness extraction step,
						including the following:<h:p/><h:ul>
						<h:li>The description must include how an approved untruncated MAC function is
							being used for the randomness extraction step and the evaluator must verify
							the TSS describes that the output length (in bits) of the MAC function is at
							least as large as the targeted security strength (in bits) of the parameter set
							employed by the key establishment scheme (see Tables 1-3 of SP 800-56C).</h:li>
						<h:li>The description must include how the MAC function being used for the
							randomness extraction step is related to the PRF used in the key expansion and
							verify the TSS description includes the correct MAC function:<h:ul>
							<h:li>If an HMAC-hash is used in the randomness extraction step, then the same
								HMAC-hash (with the same hash function hash) is used as the PRF in the
								key expansion step.</h:li>
							<h:li>If an AES-CMAC (with key length 128, 192, or 256 bits) is used in the
								randomness extraction step, then AES-CMAC with a 128-bit key is used
								as the PRF in the key expansion step.</h:li></h:ul></h:li>
						<h:li>The description must include the lengths of the salt values being used in the
							randomness extraction step and the evaluator shall verify the TSS description
							includes correct salt lengths:<h:ul>
							<h:li>If an HMAC-hash is being used as the MAC, the salt length can be any
								value up to the maximum bit length permitted for input to the hash
								function hash.</h:li>
							<h:li>If an AES-CMAC is being used as the MAC, the salt length shall be the
								same length as the AES key (i.e. 128, 192, or 256 bits).</h:li></h:ul></h:li>
						</h:ul>
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall verify that the AGD guidance instructs the administrator how
						to configure the TOE to use the selected key types for all uses identified in the ST.<h:p/>
					</Guidance>
					<KMD>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that:<h:ul>
						<h:li>The KMD describes the complete key derivation chain and the description
							must be consistent with the description in the TSS. For all key derivations the
							TOE must use a method as described in the cPP table. There should be no
							uncertainty about how a key is derived from another in the chain.</h:li>
						<h:li>The length of the key derivation key is defined by the PRF. The evaluator
							should check whether the key derivation key length is consistent with the
							length provided by the selected PRF.</h:li>
						<h:li>If a key is used as an input to several KDFs, each invocation must use a
							distinct context string. If the output of a KDF execution is used for multiple
							cryptographic keys, those keys must be disjoint segments of the output.</h:li>
						</h:ul>
					</KMD>
					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall perform one or more of the following tests to verify the
						correctness of the key derivation function, depending on the specific functions that
						are supported:<h:p/>
						Preconditions for testing:<h:ul>
						<h:li>Specification of input parameter to the key derivation function to be tested</h:li>
						<h:li>Specification of further required input parameters</h:li>
						<h:li>Access to derived keys</h:li></h:ul>

						The below tests are derived from Key Derivation using Pseudorandom Functions
						(SP 800-108) Validation System (KBKDFVS), Updated 4 January 2016, Section
						6.2, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<h:p/>
						<h:b>KDF-CTR: Counter Mode Tests:</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall determine the following characteristics of the key derivation

						<h:li>One or more pseudorandom functions that are supported by the

						<h:li>One or more of the values {8, 16, 24, 32} that equal the length of the binary

						<h:li>The length (in bits) of the output of the PRF (h).</h:li>
						<h:li>Minimum and maximum values for the length (in bits) of the derived keying
							material (L). These values can be equal if only one value of L is supported.
							These must be evenly divisible by h.</h:li>
						<h:li>Up to two values of L that are NOT evenly divisible by h.</h:li>
						<h:li>Location of the counter relative to fixed input data: before, after, or in the
							middle.<h:ul>
							<h:li>Counter before fixed input data: fixed input data string length (in bytes),
								fixed input data string value.</h:li>
							<h:li>Counter after fixed input data: fixed input data string length (in bytes),
								fixed input data string value.</h:li>
							<h:li>Counter in the middle of fixed input data: length of data before counter (in
								bytes), length of data after counter (in bytes), value of string input before
								counter, value of string input after counter.</h:li></h:ul></h:li>
						<h:li>The length (I_length) of the input values I.</h:li></h:ul>
						For each supported combination of I_length, MAC, salt, PRF, counter location,
						value of r, and value of L, the evaluator shall generate 10 test vectors that include
						pseudorandom input values I, and pseudorandom salt values. If there is only one
						value of L that is evenly divisible by h, the evaluator shall generate 20 test vectors
						for it. For each test vector, the evaluator shall supply this data to the TOE in order
						to produce the keying material output.<h:p/>
						The results from each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by
						supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To
						determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those
						obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation.<h:p/>
						<h:b>KDF-FB: Feedback Mode Tests:</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall determine the following characteristics of the key derivation
						function:<h:ul>
						<h:li>One or more pseudorandom functions that are supported by the
							implementation (PRF).</h:li>
						<h:li>The length (in bits) of the output of the PRF (h).</h:li>

						<h:li>Up to two values of L that are NOT evenly divisible by h.</h:li>
						<h:li>Whether or not zero-length IVs are supported.</h:li>
						<h:li>Whether or not a counter is used, and if so:<h:ul>
							<h:li>One or more of the values {8, 16, 24, 32} that equal the length of the

									before counter, value of string input after counter.</h:li></h:ul></h:li></h:ul></h:li>
						<h:li>The length (I_length) of the input values L.</h:li></h:ul>
						For each supported combination of I_length, MAC, salt, PRF, counter location (if
						a counter is used), value of r (if a counter is used), and value of L, the evaluator
						shall generate 10 test vectors that include pseudorandom input values I and
						pseudorandom salt values. If the KDF supports zero-length IVs, five of these test
						vectors will be accompanied by pseudorandom IVs and the other five will use zerolength IVs. If zero-length IVs are not supported, each test vector will be
						accompanied by an pseudorandom IV. If there is only one value of L that is evenly
						divisible by h, the evaluator shall generate 20 test vectors for it.<h:p/>
						For each test vector, the evaluator shall supply this data to the TOE in order to
						produce the keying material output. The results from each test may either be
						obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and
						receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall
						compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a
						known good implementation.<h:p/>
						<h:b>KDF-DPI: Double Pipeline Iteration Mode Tests:</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall determine the following characteristics of the key derivation
						function:<h:ul>
						<h:li>One or more pseudorandom functions that are supported by the
							implementation (PRF).</h:li>
						<h:li>The length (in bits) of the output of the PRF (h).</h:li>
						<h:li>Minimum and maximum values for the length (in bits) of the derived keying
							material (L). These values can be equal if only one value of L is supported.

						<h:li>Up to two values of L that are NOT evenly divisible by h.</h:li>
						<h:li>Whether or not a counter is used, and if so:<h:ul>

						For each supported combination of I_length, MAC, salt, PRF, counter location (if
						a counter is used), value of r (if a counter is used), and value of L, the evaluator
						shall generate 10 test vectors that include pseudorandom input values I, and
						pseudorandom salt values. If there is only one value of L that is evenly divisible by
						h, the evaluator shall generate 20 test vectors for it.<h:p/>
						For each test vector, the evaluator shall supply this data to the TOE in order to

						compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a
						known good implementation.<h:p/>
						<h:b>KDF-XOR: Intermediate Keys Method</h:b><h:p/>
						If the selected algorithm is a hash then the testing of the hash primitive is the only
						required Evaluation Activity. If the selected algorithm is XOR then no separate
						primitive testing is necessary.<h:p/>
<!--						<h:b>KeyDrv5: Concatenated Keys Method</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator should confirm that the combined length of the concatenated keys

                        The TSF hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte-oriented
						mode. In this mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length;
						i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the
						bit-oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different

                        hash function to be tested. The evaluators then formulate a set of 100 messages and
                        associated digests by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The
                        evaluators then ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are

						<h:b><h:u>SHA-3 Tests</h:u></h:b><h:br/>
						The tests below are derived from the The Secure Hash Algorithm-3 Validation System (SHA3VS), 
						Updated: April 7, 2016, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<h:p/>
						For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits. The capacity, c,
						is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.  <h:p/>
						The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The first is a bit-oriented
						mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages 
						that are an integral number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be
						hashed is divisible by 8). Separate tests for each orientation are given below. <h:p/>
						The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and orientation
						implemented by the TSF and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP. The evaluator shall
						compare digest values produced by a known-good SHA-3 implementation against those generated by
						running the same values through the TSF.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Short Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate+1 short messages. The length of the messages
						ranges sequentially from 0 to rate bits. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The
						evaluators compute the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result
						is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the
						TOE does not support zero-length messages.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Short Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate/8+1 short messages. The length of the
						messages ranges sequentially from 0 to rate/8 bytes, with each message being an integral number of 
						bytes. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message
						digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages
						are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the TOE does not support zero-length
						messages.<h:br/><h:p/>
						<h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size from 
						rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate
						of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.)
						The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for
						each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided
						to the TSF.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from (rate+(rate+8))
						to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits.
						Therefore 100 messages will be generated of lengths 2184, 3280, 4376, …, 110688 bits.) The message
						text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the
						messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Monte Carlo) Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluators supply a seed of d bits (where d is the length of the message digest produced by
						the hash function to be tested. This seed is used by a pseudorandom function to generate 100,000 
						message digests. One hundred of the digests (every 1000th digest) are recorded as checkpoints. The
						TOE then uses the same procedure to generate the same 100,000 message digests and 100 checkpoint
						values. The evaluators then compare the results generated ensure that the correct result is
						produced when the messages are generated by the TSF.<h:p/>

					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key generation routines of the
						supported schemes using the following tests:<h:p/>
						<h:b>If ECDH-NIST or ECDH-BPC is claimed:</h:b><h:p/>
						<h:b>SP800-56A Key Agreement Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement
						schemes using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for
						each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of
						the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation.
						These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
						value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key
						Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall
						also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented
						correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of
						the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<h:p/>
						<h:i>Function Test</h:i><h:p/>
						The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
						schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
						vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
						each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type,
						and, if supported, key confirmation role-key confirmation type combination, the
						tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain
						parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public
						keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being
						tested.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static
						or ephemeral), the MAC tags, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other
						Information field OI and TOE id fields.<h:p/>
						If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain
						only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret. <h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
						scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value,
						derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from
						these values.<h:p/>
						If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each
						implemented approved MAC algorithm.<h:p/>
						<h:i>Validity Test</h:i><h:p/>
						The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
						and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this
						test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions
						included in the SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which
						errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24
						(FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter
						values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s
						public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the
						other info and TOE id fields.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
						recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
						incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
						data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
						(only ECC) public key validation, The evaluator shall also individually inject errors
						in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
						TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation
						function or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test
						vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement
						results (they should pass).<h:p/>
						The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
						using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
						with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
						these errors.<h:p/>
						<h:b>If KAS1, KAS2, KTS-OAEP, or RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 is claimed:</h:b><h:p/>
						<h:b>SP800-56B and PKCS#1 Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
						If the TOE acts as a sender, the following evaluation activity shall be performed to
						ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
						key establishment scheme:<h:p/>
						To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
						good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
						supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key
						confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
						key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
						KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
						vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any
						additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key 
						confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
						evaluator shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with
						the same inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use
						the MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used
						in normal operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the
						ciphertext in the test vector.<h:p/>
						If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following evaluation activities shall be performed
						to ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
						key establishment scheme:<h:p/>
						To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
						good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
						supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
						confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
						key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
						KTSOAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
						vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
						any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
						confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
						evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and
						ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the
						plain text keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
						incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
						the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption
						errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not
						reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted
						or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported,
						the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of
						the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B
						section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure
						that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each.<h:p/>
						<h:b>DH:</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify the correctness of each TSF implementation of each
						supported Diffie-Hellman group by comparison with a known good
						implementation.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Curve25519:</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of the key agreement scheme
						using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key
						agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key
						agreement scheme according to the specification. These components include the
						calculation of the shared secret K and the hash of K.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Function Test</h:b><h:p/>
						The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
						schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
						vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
						each supported key agreement role and hash function combination, the tester shall
						generate 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
						on the scheme being tested.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the hash of K. The
						evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
						scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value
						K and compare the hash generated from this value.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Validity Test</h:b><h:p/>
						The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
						and invalid key agreement results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set
						of 30 test vectors consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and
						the TOE’s public/private key pairs.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
						recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
						incorrect: the shared secret value K or the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors
						shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
						(they should pass).<h:p/>
						The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme

					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall check that the TSS includes a description of encryption
						functions used for symmetric key encryption. The evaluator should check that this
						description of the selected encryption function includes the key sizes and modes of
						operations as specified in the cPP table 9 “Supported Methods for Symmetric Key
						Cryptography Operation.”<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall check that the TSS describes the means by which the TOE
						satisfies constraints on algorithm parameters included in the selections made for
						‘cryptographic algorithm’ and ‘list of standards’.<h:p/> 
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						If the product supports multiple modes, the evaluator shall examine the vendor’s
						documentation to determine that the method of choosing a specific mode/key size
						by the end user is described.<h:p/>
					</Guidance>
					<KMD>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that the points at which symmetric
						key encryption and decryption occurs are described, and that the complete data path
						for symmetric key encryption is described. The evaluator checks that this
						description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS.<h:p/>
						Assessment of the complete data path for symmetric key encryption includes
						confirming that the KMD describes the data flow from the device’s host interface
						to the device’s non-volatile memory storing the data, and gives information
						enabling the user data datapath to be distinguished from those situations in which
						data bypasses the data encryption engine (e.g. read-write operations to an
						unencrypted Master Boot Record area). The evaluator shall ensure that the
						documentation of the data path is detailed enough that it thoroughly describes the
						parts of the TOE that the data passes through (e.g. different memory types,
						processors and co-processors), its encryption state (i.e. encrypted or unencrypted)
						in each part, and any places where the data is stored. For example, any caching or
						buffering of the data should be identified and distinguished from the final
						destination in non-volatile memory (the latter represents the location from which
						the host will expect to retrieve the data in future).<h:p/>
						If support for AES-CTR is claimed and the counter value source is internal to the
						TOE, the evaluator shall verify that the KMD describes the internal counter
						mechanism used to ensure that it provides unique counter block values.<h:p/>
					</KMD>
					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						The following tests are conditional based upon the selections made in the SFR. The
						evaluator shall perform the following test or witness respective tests executed by
						the developer. The tests must be executed on a platform that is as close as practically
						possible to the operational platform (but which may be instrumented in terms of,
						for example, use of a debug mode). Where the test is not carried out on the TOE
						itself, the test platform shall be identified and the differences between test
						environment and TOE execution environment shall be described.<h:p/>
						Preconditions for testing:<h:ul>
						<h:li>Specification of keys as input parameter to the function to be tested</h:li>
						<h:li>specification of required input parameters such as modes</h:li>

						Additionally, the evaluator shall perform the following negative tests:<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 1: (invalid plaintext length):</h:b><h:p/>
						Determine the valid plaintext lengths of the implementation from the TOE

						plaintexts of invalid length by testing plaintext of the following lengths: 1) plaintext
						with length greater than 64 semi-blocks, 2) plaintext with bit-length not divisible
						by 8, and 3) plaintext with length 0.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 2: (invalid ciphertext length):</h:b>
						Determine the valid ciphertext lengths of the implementation from the TOE
						specification. Verify that the implementation of KWP-AD in the TOE rejects
						ciphertexts of invalid length by testing ciphertext of the following lengths: 1)
						ciphertext with length greater than 65 semi-blocks, 2) ciphertext with bit-length not

						<h:b>Test 3: (invalid ICV2):</h:b>
						Test that the implementation detects invalid ICV2 values by encrypting any
						plaintext value four times using a different value for ICV2 each time as follows:
						Start with a base ICV2 of 0xA65959A6. For each of the four tests change a different 
						byte of ICV2 to a different value, so that each of the four bytes is changed once.
						Verify that the implementation of KWP-AD in the TOE outputs FAIL for each test.<h:p/>

						Generate one ciphertext using algorithm KWP-AE with substring [len(P)/8]32 of S
						replaced by each of the following 32-bit values, where len(P) is the length of P in

						The tests below are derived from “The Key Wrap Validation System (KWVS),

						The evaluator shall test the authenticated-encryption functionality of AES-KW for
						each combination of the following input parameters:<h:ul>
						<h:li>Supported key lengths selected in the ST (e.g. 128 bits, 256 bits)</h:li>
						<h:li>Five plaintext lengths:<h:ul>
							<h:li>Two lengths that are non-zero multiples of 128 bits (two semi-block
								lengths)</h:li>
							<h:li>Two lengths that are odd multiples of the semi-block length (64 bits)</h:li>
							<h:li>The largest supported plaintext length less than or equal to 4096 bits.</h:li></h:ul>
						</h:li></h:ul><h:p/>
						For each set of the above parameters the evaluator shall generate a set of 100 key
						and plaintext pairs and obtain the ciphertext that results from AES-KW
						authenticated encryption. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the 
						results with those obtained from the AES-KW authenticated-encryption function of
						a known good implementation.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the authenticated-decryption functionality of AES-KW
						using the same test as for authenticated-encryption, replacing plaintext values with
						ciphertext values and AES-KW authenticated-encryption (KW-AE) with AES-KW
						authenticated-decryption (KW-AD). For the authenticated-decryption test, 20 out
						of the 100 trials per plaintext length must have ciphertext values that are not
						authentic; that is, they fail authentication.<h:p/>
						Additionally, the evaluator shall perform the following negative tests:<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 1 (invalid plaintext length):</h:b><h:p/>
						Determine the valid plaintext lengths of the implementation from the TOE
						specification. Verify that the implementation of KW-AES in the TOE rejects
						plaintexts of invalid length by testing plaintext of the following lengths: 1) plaintext
						length greater than 64 semi-blocks, 2) plaintext bit-length not divisible by 64, 3)

						<h:b>Test 2 (invalid ciphertext length):</h:b><h:p/>
						Determine the valid ciphertext lengths of the implementation from the TOE
						specification. Verify that the implementation of KW-AD in the TOE rejects
						ciphertexts of invalid length by testing ciphertext of the following lengths: 1)
						ciphertext with length greater than 65 semi-blocks, 2) ciphertext with bit-length not

						<h:b>Test 3 (invalid ICV1):</h:b><h:p/>
						Test that the implementation detects invalid ICV1 values by encrypting any
						plaintext value eight times using a different value for ICV1 each time as follows:
						Start with a base ICV1 of 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6. For each of the eight tests
						change a different byte to a different value, so that each of the eight bytes is changed

					A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot be explained
					by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a hardware based
					noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical process that
					cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of an odd number
					of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse traveling from 
					inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so the precise 
					time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as various
					physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to the
					next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that 
					contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists 
					of the oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the 
					inverters – a rate that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural

						both inbound and outbound packets in terms of the IPsec policy. The TSS describes the rules that are
						available and the resulting actions available after matching a rule. The TSS describes how the available
						rules and actions form the SPD using terms defined in RFC 4301 such as BYPASS (e.g., no encryption),
						DISCARD (e.g., drop the packet), and PROTECT (e.g., encrypt the packet) actions defined in RFC 4301.
						<h:p/>
						As noted in section 4.4.1 of RFC 4301, the processing of entries in the SPD is non-trivial and the evaluator
						shall determine that the description in the TSS is sufficient to determine which rules will be applied given
						the rule structure implemented by the TOE. For example, if the TOE allows specification of ranges,
						conditional rules, etc., the evaluator shall determine that the description of rule processing (for both
						inbound and outbound packets) is sufficient to determine the action that will be applied, especially in the
						case where two different rules may apply. This description shall cover both the initial packets (that is, no
						SA is established on the interface or for that particular packet) as well as packets that are part of an
						established SA. <h:br/>

                    <Guidance>
                        The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify it instructs the Administrator how 
                        to construct entries into the SPD that specify a rule for processing a packet. The description 
                        includes all three cases – a rule that ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and 
                        flow through the TOE without being encrypted. The evaluator shall determine 
                        that the description in the operational guidance is consistent with the description in the 
                        TSS, and that the level of detail in the operational guidance is sufficient to
                        allow the administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion 
                        of how ordering of rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.<h:br/>

                        <testlist>
                            <test>The evaluator shall configure the SPD such that there is a rule for dropping a packet,
								encrypting a packet, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The selectors used in
								the construction of the rule shall be different such that the evaluator can generate a
								packet and send packets to the gateway with the appropriate fields (fields that are used
								by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports) in the packet header. The evaluator
								performs both positive and negative test cases for each type of rule (e.g., a packet that
								matches the rule and another that does not match the rule). The evaluator observes via the
								audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected
								behavior: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed to flow without modification, 
								encrypted by the IPsec implementation.</test>
                            <test>The evaluator shall devise several tests that cover a variety of scenarios for packet
								processing. As with Test 1, the evaluator ensures both positive and negative test cases
								are constructed. These scenarios shall exercise the range of possibilities for SPD entries 
								and processing modes as outlined in the TSS and operational guidance. Potential areas to
								cover include rules with overlapping ranges and conflicting entries, inbound and outbound
								packets, and packets that establish SAs as well as packets that belong to established SAs.
								The evaluator shall verify, via the audit trail and packet captures, for each scenario 
								that the expected behavior is exhibited, and is consistent with both the TSS and the
								operational guidance.</test>

						appropriately. From the RFC “A difference between IKEv1 and IKEv2 is that in IKEv1 SA lifetimes were
						negotiated. In IKEv2, each end of the SA is responsible for enforcing its own lifetime policy on the SA and
						rekeying the SA when necessary. If the two ends have different lifetime policies, the end with the shorter
						lifetime will end up always being the one to request the rekeying. If the two ends have the same lifetime
						policies, it is possible that both will initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant
						SAs). To reduce the probability of this happening, the timing of rekeying requests SHOULD be jittered.”<h:p/>

								Name field shall be performed using peer certificates with no SAN extension. Additionally, the evaluator
								shall configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE to not match the SAN in the peer’s presented
								certificate but to match the Common Name in the peer’s presented certificate, and verify that the IKE
								authentication fails.</test>
							<test>[conditional] If the TOE supports DN identifier types, the evaluator shall configure the peer's
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the subject DN in the peer's
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds. To demonstrate a bit-wise
								comparison of the DN, the evaluator shall change a single bit in the DN (preferably, in an Object Identifier
								(OID) in the DN) and verify that the IKE authentication fails. To demonstrate a comparison of DN values,

								the evaluator shall verify that the TOE verifies that the IP header matches the identifiers by setting the

					The TSF shall be capable of providing output of the RBG to tenant software on the TOE
					that request random bits.
				</title>
				<note role="application">
					ISO/IEC 18031:2011 contains three different methods of generating random numbers. Each of
					these in turn depends on underlying cryptographic primitives (hash functions/ciphers). This cPP
					allows SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 for Hash_DRBG or HMAC_DRBG
					and only AES-based implementations for CTR_DRBG. <h:p/>
					This requirement must be included in the ST if the TOE generates keys, signatures, or Salts for its
					own use or for tenant software (FCS_CKM.1/AK, FCS_CKM.1/SK, FCS_COP.1/SigGen, FCS_SKT_EXT.1) or if it provides 
					RNG services for tenant software (FCS_RBG_EXT.1).

					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it specifies the DRBG type,
						identifies the entropy sources seeding the DRBG, and state the assumed or
						calculated min-entropy supplied either separately by each source or the min-entropy
						contained in the combined seed value.<h:p/>
						In addition to the materials below, documentation shall be produced—and the
						evaluator shall perform the activities—in accordance with Appendix D of
						[DSCcPP].<h:p/>

					</KMD>
					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is
						configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration.<h:p/>
						If the RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate
						DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of
						random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of
						random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values
						for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce,
						and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional
						input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are additional
						input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values are randomly
						generated. “generate one block of random bits” means to generate random bits with
						number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST
						SP800-90A).<h:p/>
						If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) instantiate
						DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) generate a second
						block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block
						of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values
						for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce,
						and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional
						input to the first call to generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and
						entropy input to the call to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second
						generate call.<h:p/>
						The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the input values to
						be generated/selected by the evaluator. <h:ul>
						<h:li><h:b>Entropy input:</h:b> the length of the entropy input value must equal the seed length.</h:li>
						<h:li><h:b>Nonce:</h:b> If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does
						not use a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length.</h:li>
						<h:li><h:b>Personalization string:</h:b> The length of the personalization string must be &#8804;
						seed length. If the implementation only supports one personalization string
						length, then the same length can be used for both values. If more than one string
						length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization strings of two different
						lengths. If the implementation does not use a personalization string, no value
						needs to be supplied.</h:li>
						<h:li><h:b>Additional input:</h:b> the additional input bit lengths have the same defaults and
						restrictions as the personalization string lengths.</h:li></h:ul>

                    FIA_X509_EXT.1.1 lists the rules for validating certificates. The ST author shall select whether revocation

					for SSH, TLS, and HTTPs and, if implemented, must be validated to contain the corresponding 
					extendedKeyUsage.<h:p/>
                    OCSP stapling and OCSP multi-stapling support only TLS server certificate validation. If other certificate

					Regardless of the selection of TSF or TOE platform, the validation must result in a trusted root
					CA certificate in a root store managed by the platform.<h:p/>
					OCSP responses are signed using either the certificate’s issuer’s CA certificate or an OCSP certificate
					issued to an OCSP responder delegated by that issuer to sign OCSP responses. A compliant TOE is able to
					validate OCSP responses in either case, but the OCSP signing extended key usage purpose is only required

					As a basic step, critical platform components should include immutable hardware IDs that can be listed in a hardware component

					For purposes of this requirement, hardware identities can be verified once on first boot, on every boot, when new hardware is detected, 
					or during normal operation of the platform - as long as the hardware integrity is verified before the component or device is used.<h:p/>
					The ST author lists the hardware components for which the integrity is checked, and the methods used for conducting the checks.

		The Security Objectives in <xref to="obj"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
		<xref to="threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)

		identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
		which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
		independent testing. <h:p/>
		This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP.

		The general model for evaluation of OSs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:p/> 
		After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
        TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
		the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
		Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
		contained within <xref to="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
		other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the

						and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <h:br/> 
						While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
						evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
						the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
						tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
						ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
						platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
						platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
						affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
						differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
						the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
						describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
						necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
						the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
						of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
						may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
						just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
						affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
						platform. <h:br/>
						This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
						used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
						this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
						plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
						followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
						The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
						the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
						the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
						test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
						the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
						details), and not just the “pass” result.

		how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation 
		should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the random comes from, where it is passed next, any
		post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the
		entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source 
		design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.<h:p/>
        This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a 
		description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy
		rate.

    <section id="s-justification" title="Entropy Justification">
        There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence

		justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to describe this). This argument will
		include a description of the expected entropy rate and explain how you ensure that sufficient entropy is going into 
		the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be
		relied upon to produce bits with entropy.

        Documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate

<!-- Appendix E: Equivalency Guidelines -->
<appendix id="appendix-equiv" title="Equivalency Guidelines">
	
	<section id="s-vm-intro" title="Introduction">
		The purpose of equivalence in PP-based evaluations is to find a balance between evaluation rigor and commercial
		practicability--to ensure that evaluations meet customer expectations while recognizing that there is little 
		to be gained from requiring that every variation in a product or platform be fully tested. If a product is 
		found to be compliant with a PP on one platform, then all equivalent products on equivalent platforms are also
		considered to be compliant with the PP.<h:p/>
		A Vendor can make a claim of equivalence if the Vendor believes that a particular instance of their Product implements
		PP-specified security functionality in a way equivalent to the implementation of the same functionality on another 
		instance of their Product on which the functionality was tested. The Product instances can differ in version number 
		or feature level (model). Equivalence can be used to reduce the testing required across claimed evaluated configurations.
		It can also be used during Assurance Maintenance to reduce testing needed to add more evaluated configurations to a
		certification.<h:p/>
		These equivalency guidelines do not replace Assurance Maintenance requirements or NIAP Policy #5 requirements for CAVP
		certificates. Nor may equivalence be used to leverage evaluations with expired certifications.<h:p/>
		This Appendix provides guidance for determining whether Products are equivalent for purposes of evaluation against 
		the Protection Profile for General-Purpose Computing Platforms (GPCP). This guidance differs from that provided in other
		PPs in that a GPCP is itself a Platform, and thus the distinction between Product and Platform is somewhat blurred.
		This equivalency analysis is adjusted to reflect this.<h:p/>
		For a GPCP, equivalence has two aspects:<h:br />
		<h:ol>
			<h:li><h:b><h:i>Product Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> To be considered for Equivalence, GPCPs must be produced 
				by the same vendor and support the same tenant software.</h:li>
			<h:li><h:b><h:i>Technical Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> GPCPs may be considered equivalent if there are no 
				differences between them with respect to their implementations of PP-specified security 
				functionality.</h:li>
		</h:ol><h:p/>
		The equivalency determination is made in accordance with these guidelines by the Validator and Scheme using information
		provided by the Evaluator/Vendor.
	</section>
	
	<section id="s-approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
		There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor
		wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. 
		The other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce
		the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases. But
		there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is, the
		product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules and
		the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence cannot
		be claimed with that product.<h:p/>
		When performing equivalency analysis for a GPCP, the Evaluator/Vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for 
		Product Equivalence to determine the set of Products to be further considered.<h:p/>
		Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested.<h:p/>
		<h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b><h:br />
		PP-specified security functionality implemented by the TOE that differs in actual implementation between versions or product
		models break equivalence for that functionality. Likewise, the TOE invokes PP-specified security functionality
		differently in different versions or models of the TOE, then equivalence is broken for that functionality.
	</section>
	
	<section id="s-modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Equivalence">
		Product Equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels or versions of the same product are equivalent 
		for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise” edition, is it necessary
		to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient confidence that both models are compliant? <h:p/>

		Platform equivalence is based primarily on processor architecture and instruction sets.<h:p/>
		Technical equivalence is based primarily on processor architecture, instruction sets, and firmware versions. It is determined
		on a per-SFR basis.<h:p/>
		Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. Processors with the same
		architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not disqualified from
		being equivalent. If PP-specified security functionality takes the same code paths when executing on different 
		processors of the same family, then the processors can be considered equivalent with respect to that functionality.<h:p/>
		For example, if for some PP-specified security functionality, one code path is followed on platforms that support the
		AES-NI instruction and another on platforms that do not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect
		to that functionality. But if the same path is followed whether or not the platform supports AES-NI, then the
		platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.<h:p/>
		Platforms that run the same versions of the same firmware are considered equivalent with respect to any PP-specified 
		security functionality implemented by that firmware. If firmware versions are different, then more in-depth analysis
