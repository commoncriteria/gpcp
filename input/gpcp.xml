	<!-- 1.3 TOE Overview -->
    <section title="TOE Overview" id="TOEdescription">
		This Protection Profile for General-Purpose Computing Platforms (GPCP) specifies security requirements 
		for general-purpose computing platforms. A GPCP is is a hardware device that is capable of hosting one or more 
		general-purpose operating systems as defined by the Protection Profile for General Purpose 
		Operating Systems, one or more virtualization systems as defined by the Protection Profile for 
		Virtualization, or more than one application. Typical platform 
		implementations include servers, PC clients, laptops, and tablets.<h:p/>
		Mobile Device platforms as defined in the Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals and 
		Network Device platforms as defined in the collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices 
		are out of scope of this PP.  Mobile Device and Network Device platforms must be evaluated 
		against the more specific requirements in their respective specialized PPs.<h:p/>
		The core security features of GPCPs include protected firmware and a boot integrity processes. Platform firmware
		must be protected such that it is not permitted to execute if it has been modified outside of authorized and
		authenticated update processes. Other use-case-specific features include audit capabilities, Administrator
		authentication, and protections against physical tampering.

		<!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->	    
		<section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
			The TOE comprises the hardware and firmware necessary for the hosting of tenant software. Generally,
			tenant software is an operating system or virtualization system, but may also be "bare-metal" applications.
			Tenant software is outside the TOE boundary.<h:p/>
			For example, for a PC Client platform, the hardware and firmware responsible for booting the platform and 
			operation of platform devices (such as BIOS, device controller firmware, and platform management firmware would all 
			be included in the TOE. Operating systems and application software is outside the TOE.<h:p/>
			For server-class hardware, any management controller responsible for updating platform firmware (such as a 
			baseboard management controller) is expressly included within the TOE.<h:p/>
			<figure entity="images/arch.png" title="High-Level Architecture of a Generic Platform" id="toe"/><h:p/>
			Figure 1 (taken from <h:a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-193.pdf">
			NIST SP 800-193</h:a>) shows a high-level system architecture for a typical generic computing platform.
			Tenant software (operating system/virtualization system and applications) is shown in orange.
			The tenant-specific software responsible for booting the tenant (Master Boot Record, etc.) is shown
			in grey. Platform components are in blue.<h:p/>
			In general, the TOE consists of the platform components represented 
			by the blue boxes, along with their associated firmware. Any particular platform may have 
			additional hardware components, or fewer than those illustrated.<h:p/>
			<!-- TRRT 1567 -->
			<comment>Addresses TRRT 1567</comment>
			If the GPCP includes Full Drive Encryption (FDE), and the FDE component has been previously evaluated against 
			the FDEcPPs, or will be evaluated against the FDEcPPs concurrently with the GPCP evaluation, then the FDE component may be
			excluded from the TOE for purposes of the GPCP evaluation.
<!--
			<h:p/>Likewise, if the GPCP includes a Dedicated Security Component (DSC) that has been previously evaluated against 
			the DSCcPP, or will be evaluated against the DSCcPP concurrently with the GPCP evaluation, then the DSC component may be
			excluded from the TOE for purposes of the GPCP evaluation.  -->
      </section>

		<!-- 1.3.2 TOE Operational Environment -->
		<section title="TOE Operational Environment" id="TOEopenv">
			  The TOE has no platform since it is itself a platform, but the TOE does have an operational
			  environment. The OE consists of the physical environment in which the TOE operates (e.g., 
			  data center, enterprise office, vehicle, outdoors) and any networks to which the TOE may
			  be connected. Different use cases may invoke different requirements depending on the 
			  operational environment.

	<!--   1.4 Use Cases  -->
    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
		This Protection Profile supports several use cases. The cases
		enumerated below add requirements to the baseline for GPCP due to additional threats or changes in assumptions

	<!--   1.5 Roles -->
    <section title="Roles" id="roles">
		For purposes of these requirements there are two entities that interact with a general-purpose computing 
		platform: <h:ol type="1">
			<h:li>Users (unprivileged users)</h:li>
    		<h:li>Administrators (privileged users)</h:li> </h:ol>
    	Users are humans who interact with the platform through user interfaces. They usually have to authenticate 
    	themselves to tenant software (e.g. an operating system), but generally not to the platform itself. Throughout
		this document the term "user" refers generally to a person interacting with the platform.<h:p/>
    	Administrators are users who manage the platform through a management interface. The interface
    	may be local or remote to the platform. <h:p/>
		Administrators manage the physical platform, not the OS (OS Administrators would be classified
		as platform Users). Administrators must be authenticated to the platform before the platform can allow them 
		to perform administrative functions. For an EUD, this could be accomplished through an interface implemented 
		in firmware. For server-class hardware, the management interface could be implemented in a management
		controller that is part of the platform. Administrators are assumed to be acting in the best interests of the platform owner.<h:p/>
		Tenant Software generally consists of an operating system, virtualization system, or application
		that uses platform resources to run workloads on behalf of Users. Tenant software generally has the privilege 
		of the User or Administrator in whose context it runs.<h:p/>

<!-- 3.0 Security Problem Description -->
<sec:spd title="Security Problem Definition">
	The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the GPCP is expected to address, assumptions 
	about the operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the GPCP
   	is expected to enforce.<h:p/>
  	The platform has three major security responsibilities:
	<h:ul>
		<h:li>ensuring the integrity of its own firmware and hardware</h:li>
		<h:li>ensuring that it is resilient</h:li>
		<h:li>providing security services to tenant workloads</h:li>
	</h:ul>
	These responsibilities manifest as protecting: 
	<h:ul>
		<h:li>Platform firmware and hardware</h:li>
		<h:li>Platform firmware updates</h:li>
		<h:li>Tenant initialization (boot)</h:li>
	</h:ul>

						The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it describes how the TOE generates a key
						based on output from a random bit generator as specified in FCS_RBG.1. The evaluator shall
						review the TSS to verify that it describes how the functionality described by FCS_RBG.1 is
						invoked.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it identifies the usage, and key lifecycle
						for keys generated using each selected algorithm.<h:p/>
						If the TOE uses the generated key in a key chain/hierarchy then the evaluator shall verify that the
						TSS describes how the key is used as part of the key chain/hierarchy.
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall verify that the AGD instructs the administrator how to configure the TOE to
						generate keys for the selected key generation algorithms for all key types and uses identified in
						the TSS.
					</Guidance>
					<Tests>
						The following tests are conditional based upon the selections made in the SFR. 
						The evaluator shall perform the following test or witness respective tests 
						executed by the developer. The tests must be executed on a platform that is as 
						close as practically possible to the operational platform (but which may be 
						instrumented in terms of, for example, use of a debug mode). Where the test is
						not carried out on the TOE itself, the test platform shall be identified and the

				<note role="application">
					This SFR must be included in the ST if the TOE handles sensitive cryptographic keys or credentials.
					In particular, if the TOE creates or stores keys, it must be able to destroy them. Specifically, this SFR
					must be included in the ST if any of the following SFRs are claimed: FCS_CKM.1/AKG, FCS_CKM.1/SKG,
					FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM_EXT.5, FCS_COP.1/KAT, FCS_STG_EXT.1, or FIA_AFL_EXT.1<h:p/>
					The term “cryptographic keys” in this SFR includes
					the authorization data that is the entry point to a key chain and all other cryptographic keys and
					keying material (whether in plaintext or encrypted form). Examples of keys and key material include intermediate keys, 
					encryption keys, signing keys, verification keys, authentication tokens, and submasks.
					This SFR does not apply to the public
					component of asymmetric key pairs, or to keys that are permitted to remain stored such as device
					identification keys. The TOE will have mechanisms to destroy keys and key material when the keys and key material is 
					no longer needed. Based on their implementations, vendors will explain when certain keys are no longer needed.<h:p/>
					In the case of volatile memory, the selection “<h:i>removal of all references to the key directly followed
					by a request for garbage collection</h:i>” is used in a situation where the TSF cannot address the
					specific physical memory locations holding the data to be erased and therefore relies on
					addressing logical addresses (which frees the relevant physical addresses holding the old data)
					and then requesting the platform to ensure that the data in the physical addresses is no longer
					available for reading (i.e. the “garbage collection” referred to in the SFR text).<h:p/>
					The selection for destruction of data in non-volatile memory includes block erase as an option,
					and this option applies only to flash memory. A block erase does not require a read verify, since 
					the mappings of logical addresses to the erased memory locations are erased as well as the data
					itself.<h:p/>
					Some selections allow assignment of “some value that does not contain any CSP.” This means
					that the TOE uses some specified data not drawn from an RBG meeting FCS_RBG
					requirements, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The point
					of the phrase “does not contain any sensitive data” is to ensure that the overwritten data is
					carefully selected, and not taken from a general pool that might contain current or residual data
					that itself requires confidentiality protection.<h:p/>

				<aactivity>
					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying
						material (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is
						stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and
						non-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the
						point in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe
						function, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an
						intermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case. The evaluator shall
						confirm that the description of the data and storage locations is consistent with the
						functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys in the key chain are accounted
						for). (Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key then this may need to
						be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description 
						of keys with the TOE functions). <h:p/>
						The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or
						circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further
						discussion in the AGD section below). Note that reference may be made to the AGD
						for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or
						delayed.<h:p/>
						Where the ST specifies the use of “a value that does not contain any sensitive data”
						to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes
						how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern
						does not contain any sensitive data.
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay data destruction in
						some cases. The evaluator shall check that the AGD identifies
						configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction
						requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS
						(and KMD). The evaluator shall check that the AGD provides
						guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer,
						identifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some
						operation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the
						device for some particular time to maximize the probability that garbage collection
						has occurred).<h:p/>
						For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
						possible that the storage may implement wear-leveling and garbage collection. This
						may result in additional copies of the data that are logically inaccessible but persist
						physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM
						command	and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their
						deletion (this would be explained in TSS and AGD). <h:p/>
						Where TRIM is used then the TSS or AGD is also expected to describe how
						the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g. they would need not
						to be contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the
						master file table.
					</Guidance>
					<CustomEA name="KMD">
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to verify that it identifies and describes the
						interfaces that are used to service commands to read/write memory. The evaluator
						shall examine the interface description for each different media type to ensure that
						the interface supports the selections made by the ST Author.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that all keys and keying material
						identified in the TSS and KMD have been accounted for.<h:p/>
						Note that where selections include "<h:i>destruction of reference to the key directly
						followed by a request for garbage collection</h:i>" (for volatile memory) then the
						evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it explains the nature of the
						destruction of the reference, the request for garbage collection, and of the garbage
						collection process itself.
					</CustomEA>
					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
						<testlist>
							<test>
								Applied to each key or keying material held as plaintext in volatile
								memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the
								plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile
								memory).<h:p/>
								The evaluator shall:<h:ol type="1">
								<h:li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #2 to locate all
									instances of the known key value from Step #1.<h:p/>
									Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
									search commands are being used for Steps #8 and #9.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
									from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to destroy the key.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to stop execution but not exit.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary
									file.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #7 for instances of the
									known key value from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
									fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
									evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
									stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
									any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
									endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search.)</h:li>
								</h:ol><h:p/>
								Steps #1-8 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile
								memory. If a copy is found, then the test fails.<h:p/>
								Step #9 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If the
								evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately.
								Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some
								random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated
								with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run,
								then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the
								collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.<h:p/>
							</test>
							<test>
								Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
								subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<h:ol type="1">
								<h:li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
									from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the non-volatile memory the key was stored in for instances of the
									known key value from Step #1. <h:p/>
									Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
									search commands are being used for Steps #5 and #6.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</h:li>
								<h:li>Search the non-volatile memory in which the key was stored for instances
									of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</h:li>
								<h:li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
									fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
									evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
									stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
									any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
									endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search).</h:li>
								</h:ol>
								Step #6 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in non-volatile memory.
								If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail
								immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key
								(e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be
								repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this
								repeated run, then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable
								explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.<h:p/>
							</test>
							<test>
								Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
								subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<h:ol type="1">
								<h:li>Record memory of the key or keying material.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
									from Step #1.</h:li>
								<h:li>Cause the TOE to clear the key. Record the value to be used for the
									overwrite of the key. </h:li>
								<h:li>Examine the memory from Step #1 to ensure the appropriate pattern
									(recorded in Step #3) is used. </h:li>
								</h:ol>
								The test succeeds if correct pattern is found in the memory location. If the pattern
								is not found, then the test fails.

						The evaluator shall check that the TSS describes the means by which the TOE
						satisfies constraints on algorithm parameters included in the selections made for
						"cryptographic algorithm" and "list of standards."

					<CustomEA name="KMD">
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that the points at which symmetric
						key encryption and decryption occurs are described, and that the complete data path
						for symmetric key encryption is described. The evaluator checks that this
						description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS.<h:p/>
						Assessment of the complete data path for symmetric key encryption includes
						confirming that the KMD describes the data flow from the device’s host interface
						to the device’s non-volatile memory storing the data, and gives information
						enabling the user data path to be distinguished from those situations in which
						data bypasses the data encryption engine (e.g. read-write operations to an
						unencrypted Master Boot Record area). The evaluator shall ensure that the

						parts of the TOE that the data passes through (e.g. different memory types,
						processors and co-processors), its encryption state (i.e. encrypted or unencrypted)
						in each part, and any places where the data is stored. For example, any caching or
						buffering of the data should be identified and distinguished from the final
						destination in non-volatile memory (the latter represents the location from which
						the host will expect to retrieve the data in future).<h:p/>

						possible to the operational platform (but which may be instrumented in terms of,
						for example, use of a debug mode). Where the test is not carried out on the TOE
						itself, the test platform shall be identified and the differences between test
						environment and TOE execution environment shall be described.<h:p/>

                    <Guidance>
                        The evaluator checks the AGD to determine that any configuration that is required to 
                        be done to configure the functionality for the required hash sizes is present.

                        The TSF hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte-oriented
						mode. In this mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length;
						i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the
						bit-oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different
						tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the bit-oriented vs. the
						byte-oriented test macs.<h:p/>
                        The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm implemented by the TSF
						and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP. <h:p/>
                        <h:b>Assurance Activity Note:</h:b><h:br /> The following tests require the developer to provide access
						to a test platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory

                        <h:b>Short Messages Test Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
                        The evaluator devises an input set consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block length of the hash
						algorithm. The length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m bits. The message text shall
						be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluator computes the message digest for each of the messages
						and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.<h:p/>

                        The evaluator devises an input set consisting of m/8+1 messages, where m is the block length of the 
						hash algorithm. The length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m/8 bytes, with each 
						message being an integral number of bytes. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated.
						The evaluator computes the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct

                        of the hash algorithm. The length of the ith message is 512 + 99*i, where
                        1 &lt;= i &lt;= m. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly
                        generated. The evaluator computes the message digest for each of the messages and ensure
                        that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.<h:p/>
                        <h:b>Selected Long Messages Test Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
                        The evaluator devises an input set consisting of m/8 messages,
                        where m is the block length of the hash algorithm. The length of the ith message
                        is 512 + 8*99*i, where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= m/8.
                        The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluator computes the message
                        digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when
                        the messages are provided to the TSF.<h:p/>
                        <h:b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Test</h:b><h:br/>
                        This test is for byte-oriented implementations only. The evaluator randomly generates a
                        seed that is n bits long, where n is the length of the message digest produced by the
                        hash function to be tested. The evaluator then formulates a set of 100 messages and
                        associated digests by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The
                        evaluator then ensures that the correct result is produced when the messages are
                        provided to the TSF.<h:p/>
						<h:b><h:u>SHA-3 Tests</h:u></h:b><h:br/>
						The tests below are derived from the The Secure Hash Algorithm-3 Validation System (SHA3VS), 
						Updated: April 7, 2016, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<h:p/>
						For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits. The capacity, c,
						is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.  <h:p/>
						The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The first is a bit-oriented
						mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages 
						that are an integral number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be
						hashed is divisible by 8). Separate tests for each orientation are given below. <h:p/>
						The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and orientation
						implemented by the TSF and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP. The evaluator shall
						compare digest values produced by a known-good SHA-3 implementation against those generated by
						running the same values through the TSF.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Short Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluator devises an input set consisting of rate+1 short messages. The length of the messages
						ranges sequentially from 0 to rate bits. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The
						evaluator computes the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result
						is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the
						TOE does not support zero-length messages.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Short Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluator devises an input set consisting of rate/8+1 short messages. The length of the
						messages ranges sequentially from 0 to rate/8 bytes, with each message being an integral number of 
						bytes. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluator computes the message
						digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages
						are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the TOE does not support zero-length
						messages.<h:br/><h:p/>
						<h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluator devises an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size from 
						rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate
						of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.)
						The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluator computes the message digest for
						each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided
						to the TSF.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/>
						The evaluator devises an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from (rate+(rate+8))
						to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits.
						Therefore 100 messages will be generated of lengths 2184, 3280, 4376, …, 110688 bits.) The message
						text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluator computes the message digest for each of the
						messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Monte Carlo) Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator supplies a seed of d bits (where d is the length of the message digest produced by
						the hash function to be tested. This seed is used by a pseudorandom function to generate 100,000 
						message digests. One hundred of the digests (every 1000th digest) are recorded as checkpoints. The
						TOE then uses the same procedure to generate the same 100,000 message digests and 100 checkpoint
						values. The evaluator then compares the results generated ensure that the correct result is
						produced when the messages are generated by the TSF.

					This SFR must be included in the ST if digital signature verification is a service provided by 
					the TOE to tenant software, or if digital signature verification is used by the TOE itself to 
					support or implement PP-specified security functionality.<h:p/> 
					Specifically, this SFR must be included if the ST Author chooses "<h:i>implement an authenticated platform
					firmware update mechanism as described in FPT_TUD_EXT.2</h:i>" or "<h:i>implement a delayed-authentication platform
					firmware update mechanism as described in FPT_TUD_EXT.3</h:i>" in FPT_TUD_EXT.1; or if the ST Author 
					selects "<h:i>verification of a digital signature by trusted code/data</h:i>" in FPT_ROT_EXT.2.<h:p/>	
					If this SFR is included in the ST, then FCS_COP.1/Hash must also be claimed.<h:p/>
					The ST Author should choose the algorithm implemented to perform verification of digital signatures. 
					For the algorithm chosen, the ST Author should make the appropriate assignments/selections to specify the 
					parameters that are implemented for that algorithm. In particular, if ECDSA is selected as one of the signature
					algorithms, the key size specified must match the selection for the curve used in the algorithm.<h:p/>
					For elliptic curve-based schemes, the key size refers to the binary logarithm (log2) of the order of the
					base point. As the preferred approach for digital signatures, elliptic curves will be required after all the
					necessary standards and other supporting information are fully established.<h:p/>
					<comment>From catalog</comment>
					The TOE may contain a public key which is integrity protected (e.g., in hardware), in which 
					case the FDP_ITC.1 and FDP_ITC.2 dependencies do not apply.  In this case, no dependencies 
					may be chosen.  For signature verifications, private keys are not necessary, so there are no
					dependencies required for generating or destroying cryptographic keys.
				</note>
				<aactivity>
				<TSS>
					The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that it describes the overall flow of the
					signature verification. This should at least include identification of the format and
					general location (e.g., "firmware on the hard drive device" rather than “memory
					location 0x00007A4B") of the data to be used in verifying the digital signature; how
					the data received from the operational environment are brought onto the device; and
					any processing that is performed that is not part of the digital signature algorithm
					(for instance, checking of certificate revocation lists).
				</TSS>
				<Guidance/>
				<Tests>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
					Each section below contains tests the evaluator must perform for each selected
					digital signature scheme. Based on the assignments and selections in the
					requirement, the evaluator chooses the specific activities that correspond to those
					selections.<h:p/>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are not found on the TOE in its evaluated
					configuration.<h:p/>
					<h:b><h:i>RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS</h:i></h:b><h:p/>
					These tests are derived from The 186-4 RSA Validation System (RSA2VS),
					updated 8 Jul 2014, Section 6.4.<h:p/>
					The FIPS 186-4 RSA Signature Verification Test tests the ability of the TSF to
					recognize valid and invalid signatures. The evaluator shall provide a modulus and
					three associated key pairs (d, e) for each combination of selected SHA algorithm,
					modulus size and hash size. Each private key d is used to sign six pseudorandom
					messages each of 1024 bits. For five of the six messages, the public key (e),
					message, IR format, padding, or signature is altered so that signature verification
					should fail. The test passes only if all the signatures made using unaltered

					using altered parameters result in unsuccessful signature verification.<h:p/>

					recognize valid and invalid signatures. The evaluator shall provide a modulus and
					associated key pair (x, y) for each combination of selected curve, SHA algorithm,
					modulus size, and hash size. Each private key (x) is used to sign 15 pseudorandom 
					messages of 1024 bits. For eight of the fifteen messages, the message, IR format,

					The following or equivalent steps shall be taken to test the TSF.<h:p/>
					For each supported modulus size, underlying hash algorithm, and length of the
					trailer field (1- or 2-byte), the evaluator shall generate NT sets of recoverable

					<h:ol type="1">
						<h:li><h:i>N<h:sub>T</h:sub></h:i> shall be greater than or equal to 20.</h:li>
						<h:li>The length of salts shall be selected from its supported length range of salt.
							The typical length of salt is equal to the output block length of underlying
							hash algorithm (see 9.2.2 of ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010).</h:li>
						<h:li>The length of recoverable messages should be selected by considering
							modulus size, output block length of underlying hash algorithm, and length
							of salt (<h:i>L<h:sub>S</h:sub></h:i>). As described in Annex D of ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010, it is desirable
							to maximize the length of recoverable message. The following table shows
							the maximum bit-length of recoverable message that is divisible by 512, for
							some combinations of modulus size, underlying hash algorithm, and length
							of salt.

						<h:li>The length of non-recoverable messages should be selected by considering

							the authenticity of software/firmware updates, the length of non-recoverable

							length range, it means that the underlying hash algorithm is also tested for
							two or more input blocks.</h:li>
						<h:li>The evaluator shall select approximately one half of <h:i>N<h:sub>T</h:sub></h:i> sets and shall alter
							one of the values (non-recoverable message, public key exponent or
							signature) in the sets. In altering public key exponent, the evaluator shall
							alter the public key exponent while keeping the exponent odd. In altering
							signatures, the following ways should be considered:
							<h:ol type="a">
								<h:li>Altering a signature just by replacing a bit in the bit-string representation
									of the signature</h:li>
								<h:li>Altering a signature so that the trailer in the message representative

									<h:li>Setting the rightmost four bits of the message representative to the
										values other than '1100'.</h:li>
									<h:li>In the case when 1-byte trailer is used, setting the rightmost byte of
										the message representative to the values other than '0xbc', while
										keeping the rightmost four bits to '1100'.</h:li>
									<h:li>In the case when 2-byte trailer is used, setting the rightmost byte of
										the message representative to the values other than '0xcc', while
										keeping the rightmost four bits to '1100'.</h:li></h:ul></h:li>
								<h:li>In the case when 2-byte trailer is used, altering a signature so that the
									hash algorithm identifier in the trailer (i.e. the left most byte of the
									trailer) does not correspond to hash algorithms identified in the SFR.
									The hash algorithm identifiers are 0x34 for SHA-256 (see Clause 10 of
									ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018), and 0x35 for SHA-512 (see Clause 11 of
									ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018).</h:li>
								<h:li>Let <h:i>L<h:sub>S</h:sub></h:i> be the length of salt, altering a signature so that the intermediate
									bit string <h:i>D</h:i> in the message representative is set to all zeroes except for
									the rightmost <h:i>L<h:sub>S</h:sub></h:i> bits of <h:i>D</h:i>.</h:li>
								<h:li> (non-conformant signature length) Altering a signature so that the length
									of signature <h:i>&#931;</h:i> is changed to modulus size and the most significant bit of
									signature <h:i>&#931;</h:i> is set equal to '1'.</h:li>
								<h:li>(non-conformant signature) Altering a signature so that the integer
									converted from signature <h:i>&#931;</h:i> is greater than modulus <h:i>n</h:i>.</h:li>
							</h:ol>
						</h:li>
					</h:ol>
					The evaluator shall supply the NT sets to the TSF and obtain in response a set of
					NT Verification-Success or Verification-Fail values. When the Verification-Success is 
					obtained, the evaluator shall also obtain recovered message (M 1*).<h:p/>
					The evaluator shall verify that Verification-Success results correspond to the
					unaltered sets and Verification-Fail results correspond to the altered sets.<h:p/>
					For each recovered message, the evaluator shall compare the recovered message
					(M1*) with the corresponding recoverable message (M 1) in the unaltered sets.<h:p/>
					The test passes only if all the signatures made using unaltered sets result in
					Verification-Success, each recovered message (M 1*) is equal to corresponding M 
					1 in the unaltered sets, and all the signatures made using altered sets result in
					Verification-Fail.<h:p/>

					This SFR must be included in the ST if symmetric-key cryptography is a service provided by the TOE

					any of the following selections: <h:ul>
						<h:li>"<h:i>CTR_DRBG (AES)</h:i>" in FCS_RBG.1</h:li>

				</note>
				<aactivity>
					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall check that the TSS includes a description of encryption
						functions used for symmetric key encryption. The evaluator should check that this
						description of the selected encryption function includes the key sizes and modes of
						operations as specified in <xref to="fcs-cop-skc-sels"/>.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall check that the TSS describes the means by which the TOE
						satisfies constraints on algorithm parameters included in the selections made for
						"cryptographic algorithm" and "list of standards."
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						If the product supports multiple modes, the evaluator shall examine the AGD
						to determine that the method of choosing a specific mode/key size
						is described.
					</Guidance>
					<CustomEA name="KMD">
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that the points at which symmetric
						key encryption and decryption occurs are described, and that the complete data path
						for symmetric key encryption is described. The evaluator checks that this
						description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS.<h:p/>
						Assessment of the complete data path for symmetric key encryption includes
						confirming that the KMD describes the data flow from the device’s host interface
						to the device’s non-volatile memory storing the data, and gives information
						enabling the user data path to be distinguished from those situations in which
						data bypasses the data encryption engine (e.g. read-write operations to an
						unencrypted Master Boot Record area). The evaluator shall ensure that the
						documentation of the data path is detailed enough that it thoroughly describes the
						parts of the TOE that the data passes through (e.g. different memory types,
						processors and co-processors), its encryption state (i.e. encrypted or unencrypted)
						in each part, and any places where the data is stored. For example, any caching or
						buffering of the data should be identified and distinguished from the final
						destination in non-volatile memory (the latter represents the location from which
						the host will expect to retrieve the data in future).<h:p/>
						If support for AES-CTR is claimed and the counter value source is internal to the
						TOE, the evaluator shall verify that the KMD describes the internal counter
						mechanism used to ensure that it provides unique counter block values.
					</CustomEA>
					<Tests>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<h:p/>
						The following tests are conditional based upon the selections made in the SFR. The
						evaluator shall perform the following test or witness respective tests executed by
						the developer. The tests must be executed on a platform that is as close as practically
						possible to the operational platform (but which may be instrumented in terms of,
						for example, use of a debug mode). Where the test is not carried out on the TOE
						itself, the test platform shall be identified and the differences between test
						environment and TOE execution environment shall be described.<h:p/>
						Preconditions for testing:<h:ul>
						<h:li>Specification of keys as input parameter to the function to be tested</h:li>
						<h:li>specification of required input parameters such as modes</h:li>

						It is not recommended that the evaluator use values obtained from static sources such

						http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/XTSTestVectors.zip or use
						values not generated expressly to exercise the XTS-AES implementation.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall generate test values as follows:<h:p/>
						For each supported key size (256 bit (for AES-128) and 512 bit (for AES-256)

						<h:li>Two data lengths divisible by the 128-bit block size, If data unit lengths of

						Additionally, the evaluator shall perform the following negative tests:<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 1: (invalid plaintext length):</h:b>
						Determine the valid plaintext lengths of the implementation from the TOE

						plaintext of invalid length by testing plaintext of the following lengths: 1) plaintext
						with length greater than 64 semi-blocks, 2) plaintext with bit-length not divisible
						by 8, and 3) plaintext with length 0.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 2: (invalid ciphertext length):</h:b>
						Determine the valid ciphertext lengths of the implementation from the TOE

						<h:b>Test 3: (invalid ICV2):</h:b>
						Test that the implementation detects invalid ICV2 values by encrypting any
						plaintext value four times using a different value for ICV2 each time as follows:
						Start with a base ICV2 of 0xA65959A6. For each of the four tests change a different 
						byte of ICV2 to a different value, so that each of the four bytes is changed once.
						Verify that the implementation of KWP-AD in the TOE outputs FAIL for each test.<h:p/>

						Generate one ciphertext using algorithm KWP-AE with substring [len(P)/8]32 of S
						replaced by each of the following 32-bit values, where len(P) is the length of P in

						The evaluator shall test the authenticated-encryption functionality of AES-KW for
						each combination of the following input parameters:<h:ul>
						<h:li>Supported key lengths selected in the ST (e.g. 128 bits, 256 bits)</h:li>
						<h:li>Five plaintext lengths:<h:ul>
							<h:li>Two lengths that are non-zero multiples of 128 bits (two semi-block
								lengths)</h:li>
							<h:li>Two lengths that are odd multiples of the semi-block length (64 bits)</h:li>
							<h:li>The largest supported plaintext length less than or equal to 4096 bits.</h:li></h:ul>
						</h:li></h:ul><h:p/>
						For each set of the above parameters the evaluator shall generate a set of 100 key
						and plaintext pairs and obtain the ciphertext that results from AES-KW
						authenticated encryption. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the 
						results with those obtained from the AES-KW authenticated-encryption function of
						a known good implementation.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the authenticated-decryption functionality of AES-KW
						using the same test as for authenticated-encryption, replacing plaintext values with
						ciphertext values and AES-KW authenticated-encryption (KW-AE) with AES-KW
						authenticated-decryption (KW-AD). For the authenticated-decryption test, 20 out
						of the 100 trials per plaintext length must have ciphertext values that are not
						authentic; that is, they fail authentication.<h:p/>
						Additionally, the evaluator shall perform the following negative tests:<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 1 (invalid plaintext length):</h:b>
						Determine the valid plaintext lengths of the implementation from the TOE
						specification. Verify that the implementation of KW-AES in the TOE rejects
						plaintext of invalid length by testing plaintext of the following lengths: 1) plaintext
						length greater than 64 semi-blocks, 2) plaintext bit-length not divisible by 64, 3)
						plaintext with length 0, and 4) plaintext with one semi-block.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 2 (invalid ciphertext length):</h:b>
						Determine the valid ciphertext lengths of the implementation from the TOE
						specification. Verify that the implementation of KW-AD in the TOE rejects
						ciphertext of invalid length by testing ciphertext of the following lengths: 1)
						ciphertext with length greater than 65 semi-blocks, 2) ciphertext with bit-length not
						divisible by 64, 3) ciphertext with length 0, 4) ciphertext with length of one semiblock, 
						and 5) ciphertext with length of two semi-blocks.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Test 3 (invalid ICV1):</h:b>
						Test that the implementation detects invalid ICV1 values by encrypting any
						plaintext value eight times using a different value for ICV1 each time as follows:
						Start with a base ICV1 of 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6. For each of the eight tests
						change a different byte to a different value, so that each of the eight bytes is changed
						once. Verify that the implementation of KW-AD in the TOE outputs FAIL for each
						test.

                        The evaluator shall examine the AGD to verify it instructs the Administrator how 
                        to construct entries into the SPD that specify a rule for processing a packet. The description 
                        includes all three cases – a rule that ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and 
                        flow through the TOE without being encrypted. The evaluator shall determine 
                        that the description in the AGD is consistent with the description in the 
                        TSS, and that the level of detail in the AGD is sufficient to
                        allow the administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion 
                        of how ordering of rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.

								by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports) in the packet header. The evaluator
								performs both positive and negative test cases for each type of rule (e.g., a packet that
								matches the rule and another that does not match the rule). The evaluator observes via the
								audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected
								behavior: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed to flow without modification, 
								encrypted by the IPsec implementation.</test>
                            <test>The evaluator shall devise several tests that cover a variety of scenarios for packet
								processing. As with Test 1, the evaluator ensures both positive and negative test cases

								cover include rules with overlapping ranges and conflicting entries, inbound and outbound
								packets, and packets that establish SAs as well as packets that belong to established SAs.
								The evaluator shall verify, via the audit trail and packet captures, for each scenario

						rekeying the SA when necessary. If the two ends have different lifetime policies, the end with the shorter
						lifetime will end up always being the one to request the rekeying. If the two ends have the same lifetime
						policies, it is possible that both will initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant
						SAs). To reduce the probability of this happening, the timing of rekeying requests SHOULD be jittered.”<h:p/>

							<test>The evaluator shall have the TOE generate a public-private key pair, and submit a CSR (Certificate

							<test>The evaluator shall test that the TOE can properly handle revoked certificates – conditional on
								whether CRL or OCSP is selected; if both are selected, then a test is performed for each method. For
								this current version of the PP-Module, the evaluator has to only test one up in the trust chain (future

								valid certificate is used, and that the SA is established. The evaluator then attempts the test with a
								certificate that will be revoked (for each method chosen in the selection) to ensure when the certificate
								is no longer valid that the TOE will not establish an SA.</test>
							<test>[conditional] The evaluator shall generate a pre-shared key and use it, as indicated in the
								operational guidance, to establish an IPsec connection with the VPN GW peer. If the generation of the
								pre-shared key is supported, the evaluator shall ensure that establishment of the key is carried out for an

							<test>For each field of the certificate supported for comparison, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the field in the peer’s

							<test>For each field of the certificate support for comparison, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to not match the field in the peer’s
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication fails.<h:p/>
							   The following tests are conditional:</test>
							<test>[conditional] If, according to the TSS, the TOE supports both Common Name and SAN certificate
								fields and uses the preferred logic outlined in the Application Note, the tests above with the Common
								Name field shall be performed using peer certificates with no SAN extension. Additionally, the evaluator
								shall configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE to not match the SAN in the peer’s presented
								certificate but to match the Common Name in the peer’s presented certificate, and verify that the IKE
								authentication fails.</test>
							<test>[conditional] If the TOE supports DN identifier types, the evaluator shall configure the peer's
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the subject DN in the peer's
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds. To demonstrate a bit-wise
								comparison of the DN, the evaluator shall change a single bit in the DN (preferably, in an Object Identifier
								(OID) in the DN) and verify that the IKE authentication fails. To demonstrate a comparison of DN values,
								the evaluator shall change any one of the four DN values and verify that the IKE authentication fails.</test>
							<test>[conditional] If the TOE supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and supports IP address identifier types, the
								evaluator must repeat test 1 and 2 with both IPv4 address identifiers and IPv6 identifiers. Additionally,
								the evaluator shall verify that the TOE verifies that the IP header matches the identifiers by setting the
								presented identifiers and the reference identifier with the same IP address that differs from the actual IP
								address of the peer in the IP headers and verifying that the IKE authentication fails.</test>
							<test>[conditional] If, according to the TSS, the TOE performs comparisons between the peer’s ID
								payload and the peer’s certificate, the evaluator shall repeat the following test for each combination of
								supported identifier types and supported certificate fields (as above). The evaluator shall configure the
								peer to present a different ID payload than the field in the peer’s presented certificate and verify that the

					This requirement is claimed when a DRBG is seeded with entropy from one or more noise source that is outside the TOE

					If an ST Author wishes to use multiple internal noise sources, they iterate this requirement
					for each noise source used by the TSF.<h:p/>
					Hardware-based noise sources are entropy sources whose primary function is noise generation, 
					such as ring oscillators, diodes, and thermal noise.  While a TOE may use software to collect
					the noise from these hardware sources, these are not software-based.  Software-based noise 
					sources are those sources that have some other primary function, and the noise is a byproduct 
					of their normal operation.  Examples of software-based noise sources are user or system-based 
					events, reading the least significant bits from an event timer, etc. <h:p/>
					Hardware-based noise sources may be stochastically modelled, in which case the amount of 
					entropy is well understood.  Software-based noise sources are usually less well understood 
					and therefore will typically take a more conservative approach, gathering larger numbers of 
					bits than required, then performing a compression function to derive the final output. 
					Software-based noise sources often rely on an entropy estimator.

                    FIA_X509_EXT.1.1 lists the rules for validating certificates. The ST Author should select whether revocation
					status is verified using OCSP or CRLs. FIA_X509_EXT.2 requires that certificates are used for IPsec;
					this use requires that the extendedKeyUsage rules are verified. Certificates may optionally be used 
					for SSH, TLS, and HTTPS and, if implemented, must be validated to contain the corresponding 
					extendedKeyUsage.<h:p/>
                    OCSP stapling and OCSP multi-stapling support only TLS server certificate validation. If other certificate 
					types are validated, either OCSP or CRL must be claimed. If OCSP is not supported the EKU provision 
					for checking the OCSP Signing purpose is met by default.<h:p/>
					Regardless of the selection of TSF or TOE platform, the validation must result in a trusted root
					CA certificate in a root store managed by the platform.<h:p/>
					OCSP responses are signed using either the certificate’s issuer’s CA certificate or an OCSP certificate
					issued to an OCSP responder delegated by that issuer to sign OCSP responses. A compliant TOE is able to
					validate OCSP responses in either case, but the OCSP signing extended key usage purpose is only required

				<note role="application">
					The purpose of this objective requirement is to encourage platform and component vendors to adopt mechanisms similar to those
					defined in upcoming NIST SP 1800-34 for ensuring the integrity of the hardware supply chain. The scope of SP 1800-34 is to cover 
					"manufacturing and OEM processes that protect against counterfeits, tampering, and insertion of 
					unexpected software and hardware, and the corresponding customer processes that verify that client and server computing devices and
					components have not been tampered with or otherwise modified. Manufacturing processes that cannot be verified by the customer are explicitly
					out of scope."<h:p/>
					As a basic step, SP 1800-34 specifies that critical platform components should include immutable hardware IDs that can be listed in a hardware component  
					manifest that is provided to the purchaser and signed by the manufacturer. It should then be possible for the TOE to verify 
					the signature on the manifest and check that each hardware ID in the manifest matches the IDs in the actual hardware.
					The component manifest and hardware IDs provide proof of provenance for the TOE and its hardware components.<h:p/>
					For purposes of this requirement, hardware identities can be verified once on first boot, on every boot, when new hardware is detected, 
					or during normal operation of the platform - as long as the hardware integrity is verified before the component or device is used.<h:p/>
					The ST Author lists the hardware components for which the integrity is checked, and the methods used for conducting the checks. 
					"Critical components" generally would include chassis, motherboards, CPUs, network cards, memory chips, hard drives, controllers, 
					graphics processors, and service controllers.

		The Security Objectives in <xref to="SecurityObjectivesTOE"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
		<xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)
		in <xref to="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
		identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
		which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
		independent testing. <h:p/>
		This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP. 
		Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified both in <xref to="SFRs"/> 
		as well as in this section. <h:p/> 
		The general model for evaluation of GPCPs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:p/> 
		After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
        TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
		the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
		Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities
		contained within <xref to="SFRs"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
		other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
		TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in <xref to="SFRs"/> also provide
		clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant
		with the PP.

				themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,

						and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <h:p/> 
						While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
						evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in

						tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the

						platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
						platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
						affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
						differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
						the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
						describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
						necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
						the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
						of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
						may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
						just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely

						This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be

						plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
						followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:p/>
						The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
						the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
						the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
						test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of

<!-- Appendix E: Entropy Documentation and Assessment -->
<appendix id="appendix-entropy" title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment">
    <section id="s-design" title="Design Description">
        Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source
		components. It will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how it works, how entropy is produced, and
		how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation 
		should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the random comes from, where it is passed next, any
		post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the
		entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source 
		design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.<h:p/>
        This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a 
		description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy
		rate.
    </section>
    <section id="s-justification" title="Entropy Justification">
        There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence 
		in the entropy source exhibiting probabilistic behavior (an explanation of the probability distribution and
		justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to describe this). This argument will
		include a description of the expected entropy rate and explain how to ensure that sufficient entropy is going into 
		the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be
		relied upon to produce bits with entropy.
    </section>
    <section id="s-oc" title="Operating Conditions">
        Documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate 
		random data. It will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the entropy
		source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which
		the entropy source is known to malfunction or become inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of
		the source shall be included.
    </section>
    <section id="s-health" title="Health Testing">
        More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description
		of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup,
		continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale indicating why each test is
		believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.

<!-- Appendix F: Equivalency Guidelines -->
<appendix id="appendix-equiv" title="Equivalency Guidelines">
	
	<section id="s-vm-intro" title="Introduction">
		The purpose of equivalence in PP-based evaluations is to find a balance between evaluation rigor and commercial
		practicability--to ensure that evaluations meet customer expectations while recognizing that there is little 
		to be gained from requiring that every variation in a product or platform be fully tested. Generally, if a product is 
		found to be compliant with a PP on a particular platform, then all equivalent products on equivalent platforms are also
		considered to be compliant with the PP. In this case, since the GPCP is itself a platform, only equivalent 
		GPCP products are considered in the analysis.<h:p/>
		A vendor can make a claim of equivalence if the vendor believes that a particular instance of their product implements
		PP-specified security functionality in a way equivalent to the implementation of the same functionality on another 
		instance of their product on which the functionality was tested. The product instances can differ in version number 
		or feature level (model). Equivalence can be used to reduce the testing required across claimed evaluated configurations.
		It can also be used during Assurance Maintenance to reduce testing needed to add more evaluated configurations to a
		certification.<h:p/>
		These equivalency guidelines do not replace Assurance Maintenance requirements or NIAP Policy #5 requirements for CAVP
		certificates. Nor may equivalence be used to leverage evaluations with expired certifications.<h:p/>
		This appendix provides guidance for determining whether products are equivalent for purposes of evaluation against 
		the GPCPPP. This guidance differs from that provided in other
		PPs in that a GPCP is itself a platform, and thus the distinction between product and platform is somewhat blurred.
		This equivalency analysis is adjusted to reflect this.<h:p/>
		For a GPCP, equivalence has two aspects:<h:br />
		<h:ol>
			<h:li><h:b><h:i>Product Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> To be considered equivalent, GPCPs must be produced 
				by the same vendor and support the same tenant software.</h:li>
			<h:li><h:b><h:i>Technical Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> GPCPs may be considered equivalent if there are no 
				differences between them with respect to their implementations of PP-specified security 
				functionality.</h:li>
		</h:ol><h:p/>
		The equivalency determination is made in accordance with these guidelines by the validator and scheme using information
		provided by the evaluator/vendor.
	</section>
	
	<section id="s-approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
		There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor
		wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. 
		The other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce
		the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases. But
		there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is, the
		product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules and
		the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence cannot
		be claimed with that product.<h:p/>
		When performing equivalency analysis for a GPCP, the evaluator/vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for 
		Product Equivalence to determine the set of products to be further considered.<h:p/>
		Each non-equivalent product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested.<h:p/>
		<h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b><h:br />
		PP-specified security functionality implemented by the TOE that differs in actual implementation between versions or product
		models break equivalence for that functionality. Likewise, the TOE invokes PP-specified security functionality
		differently in different versions or models of the TOE, then equivalence is broken for that functionality.
	</section>
	
	<section id="s-modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Equivalence">
		Product Equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels or versions of the same product are equivalent 
		for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise” edition, is it necessary
		to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient confidence that both models are compliant? <h:p/>

		Platform equivalence is based primarily on processor architecture and instruction sets.<h:p/>
		Technical equivalence is based primarily on processor architecture, instruction sets, and firmware versions. It is determined
		on a per-SFR basis.<h:p/>
		Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. Processors with the same
		architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not disqualified from
		being equivalent. If PP-specified security functionality takes the same code paths when executing on different 
		processors of the same family, then the processors can be considered equivalent with respect to that functionality.<h:p/>
		For example, if for some PP-specified security functionality, one code path is followed on platforms that support the
		AES-NI instruction and another on platforms that do not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect
		to that functionality. But if the same path is followed whether or not the platform supports AES-NI, then the
		platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.<h:p/>
		Platforms that run the same versions of the same firmware are considered equivalent with respect to any PP-specified 
		security functionality implemented by that firmware. If firmware versions are different, then more in-depth analysis
